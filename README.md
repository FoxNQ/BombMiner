I Think this game no need Document , but if you want , it here :)

for me <vector> easy to control it, so i will use it in this project.
 
///Point <-- it wil be save location of player.

///Bitem <-- use Create and Draw A Matrix Map

///BControler <-- yah, of course it using Control this game
                  
   +CreateMap <-- i use two for loop Create matrix and use <random> to set random bomb.
     +Func getRandomBool Will support this Create Matrix.
   
   +DrawMap <-- still two for loop to Draw Matrix To Console
   
   +KeyCheck <-- use while loop and GetAsyncKeyStats to read key user press to move Point.
